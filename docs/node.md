* To start server.js it is necessary to have installed the express.js module of node.js.
```js
npm install express
```

* To develop the application we will need the nodemon module so that we do not have to restart the server every time we make a change to it
```js
npm install nodemon
```

* To start it in developer mode so that it updates with each change we make to the code:
```js
npm run dev
```
