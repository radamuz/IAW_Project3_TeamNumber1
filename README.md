## Description
We must create a web application of a restaurants guide, with a search engine and restaurants ratings, with Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB technologies, deployed using Docker.

## Requirements
* We need to install node.js
```bash
sudo apt install node
```

* We need to install NPM (Node Package Manager)
```bash
sudo apt install npm
```

* To start server.js it is necessary to have installed the express.js module of node.js.
```js
npm install express
```

## Init

* Then we will start the server in normal mode:
```js
npm run start
```

* Or we can choose to start it in developer mode so that it updates with each change we make to the code:
```js
npm run dev
```
